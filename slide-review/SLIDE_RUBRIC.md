# Slide Validation Rubric

Standards and review procedure for Marp slide decks. Tuned for technical/didactic
decks — lectures, technical talks, workshops — not generic business decks. Written
to be executable by **any** reviewer — a human, or any coding agent. It uses only
shell commands and file paths; no agent-specific tooling.

The bar is deliberately high, especially for figures. A slide that merely "works"
but is not simple, clear, and easy to see does **not** pass. The reviewer's job is
to report findings, not to fix them — fixing is a separate task.

## Core principles

1. **One slide, one point.** Every slide teaches exactly one thing, stateable in one sentence.
2. **Dense, but progressive.** Slides should be substantive, never thin — but density
   must accumulate one component at a time (progressive disclosure), not land all at once.
3. **Teach visually.** The figure carries the explanation; text supports the figure.
4. **Conversational.** Slides talk *with* the audience. Questions come before answers.
5. **One complexity at a time.** Never introduce two unfamiliar ideas in the same step.
6. **Interactive demo at every milestone.** Milestones are roughly the sections (parts) of the deck.

## How to run a review

### 1. Render — always

```sh
cd <deck dir>
marp <deck>.md --theme ~/.claude/skills/slide-build/theme.css --allow-local-files \
     --images png -o review/slide.png --no-stdin   # emits review/slide.001.png … one per slide
```

Use `--theme <your-theme>.css` if the deck has its own theme instead of the bundled
default. Never judge figures or layout from the markdown source alone — visibility,
edge crossings, label sizes, and balance are only assessable on rendered slides. PNG
export shows each slide's **final** state; progressive disclosure (fragmented `*`
lists, build sequences) must be verified in the source.

### 2. Student pass

View every slide in order, at reading speed. For each slide, write down its point
in one sentence. If you cannot — or you need two sentences joined by "and" — that
is a P1 finding. Note every place your eye hesitates or wanders: that hesitation
is usually a figure or layout finding.

### 3. Checklist pass

Go slide by slide against every criterion below. For dense slides, open the
markdown source and confirm a disclosure mechanism exists (`*` fragment lists, or
a build sequence of consecutive slides adding one element to the same figure).

### 4. Structure pass

At deck level:

- List the parts (section dividers) and map them onto the four-act arc (S1–S4).
- List the milestones (≈ part boundaries) and check each has an interactive
  demo or audience activity (S5). The report must include this milestone list.

### 5. Report

Use the report format at the bottom. Order findings by severity, then slide number.

## Severity and verdict

- **BLOCKER** — violates a core principle; the slide fails its teaching job.
  Must be fixed before the deck is used.
- **MAJOR** — noticeably hurts clarity or engagement; fix before delivery.
- **MINOR** — polish; fix when touching the slide anyway.

**Verdict:** `FAIL` if any Blocker · `NEEDS WORK` if any Major · `PASS` otherwise
(Minors alone still pass).

## Criteria

### P — One point per slide

- **P1 · Blocker — Single point.** A slide introduces at most **one** new concept.
  Two or more new definitions, claims, or mechanisms on one slide is a Blocker
  (e.g. defining a term *and* introducing a special case of it).
  *Check:* the one-sentence test from the student pass.
- **P2 · Major — Progressive disclosure.** A dense slide (final state has more than
  a title + one figure + one short text block) must build one component at a time:
  fragmented lists (`*` markers in Marp, not `-`), or a build sequence of
  consecutive slides that add one element to the same figure. Dense-and-static is a Major.
- **P3 · Minor — No thin slides.** Slides must be dense in substance. A slide whose
  final state is nearly empty, or that restates the previous slide without adding
  anything, is a Minor.

### F — Figures (high standard — this is where most decks fail)

- **F1 · Blocker — No unexplained encodings.** Any visual variation must mean
  something stated on the slide. Node/marker sizes differ → the size must encode a
  named quantity. Same for node color, edge/line thickness, edge style, layout
  position. Otherwise all nodes are the same size, all edges the same weight.
  Unexplained complexity invites confusion.
- **F2 · Major — Minimize edge crossings.** Node-link diagrams must be laid out to
  avoid edge crossings. If the diagram is planar, draw it planar. A crossing is
  acceptable only when topologically unavoidable — and a Blocker if crossings make
  the structure hard to trace at all.
- **F3 · Major — Legible from the back row.** Labels, strokes, and contrast must
  read at rendered slide size. Thin lines, small fonts, gray-on-gray fail.
  Concretely: in-figure text must land at least **body size on the rendered slide**
  (30px type ≈ 15px x-height, for the bundled default theme). The page number is
  *not* the floor — that standard has been tried and rejected. `check_render.py`
  measures this; a failing run is a Major on every named slide.
- **F4 · Major — The figure carries the point.** The figure must show the slide's
  single point, not a multi-panel dump. Multi-panel figures are acceptable only as
  a build (one panel per step). Decorative elements that encode nothing get cut.
- **F6 · Major — No shared figures with different explanations.** If two slides
  reference the same figure file but explain it differently (different captions,
  different narrative roles), one slide gets content the other hasn't introduced.
  Emit two files. `check_deck.py` flags this automatically.
- **F5 · Minor — Palette discipline.** Use the theme tokens (accent `#3959A6`,
  accent-2 `#B14434`, accent-3 `#DAB167`, annotation gray `#6b6b6b`, for the bundled
  default theme — substitute your own theme's tokens if different). The palette is
  already good; off-palette colors are a Minor unless they collide with an existing
  encoding (then Major).

### L — Layout and format

- **L1 · Blocker — At most one text column.** Two-column layouts are fine — the
  house pattern is text + figure. Two or more columns of *text* (including
  three-way `cols3` text layouts) are a Blocker.
- **L2 · Blocker — No tables.** Tables are the worst presentation format. Convert
  every table to an annotated figure, or to a build that reveals one row-equivalent
  at a time as marked-up text/graphics.
- **L3 · Blocker — No code.** No code blocks, no inline code teaching syntax.
  A single plain-prose pointer ("hands-on in the companion notebook") is allowed.
- **L4 · Minor — Bullets in moderation.** Bullets are practical but easy to overuse:
  more than 4 items, nested bullets, or more than one list per slide is a Minor.
  A bullet list standing in where a figure should teach the idea is a Major (F4).
- **L5 · Major — No paragraph below a fragmented list.** The room reads it before the
  bullets reveal, which defeats the build. Move it above the list, fold it into the
  last fragment, or make it a fragment itself.
- **L6 · Minor — Centre shallow slides.** A slide whose content does not fill the frame
  hangs from the rule with all the slack below; it takes `<!-- _class: mid -->`, which
  centres the body block only (headings stay at their fixed y so titles line up
  deck-wide). Most question slides qualify.

### N — Narrative and tone

- **N1 · Major — One complexity at a time, in order.** A slide may rely only on
  concepts already introduced. If understanding a slide needs an idea that arrives
  later (or never), that is a Major.
- **N2 · Major — Teach visually.** Every concept slide has a visual that does the
  explaining. Exceptions: question/prompt slides, part dividers, the roadmap.
- **N3 · Major — Conversational voice.** The deck addresses the audience directly
  ("Can you…?", "Your turn", "What breaks if…?"). A whole part with no direct
  address or question is a Major; individual textbook-monologue slides are Minors.
- **N4a · Blocker — No answer leak on question slides.** The answer must not
  appear *anywhere* on the question slide — body, notes, gray text, or figcaption.
  A gray `note` leaking a puzzle's answer is a real, repeated failure mode.
  `check_deck.py` flags question slides with substantive notes (>15 words).
- **N4 · Major — Question before answer.** Key results are set up as a question,
  a beat for thinking (turn to your neighbor / take 30 seconds), then the answer.
  Revealing the punchline in the same breath as the question is a Major. The answer
  must not appear *anywhere* on the question slide — check the notes, not just the body.

### S — Deck structure (four-act arc + milestones)

- **S1 · Blocker — Act 1: story.** The deck opens with a concrete story or
  historical example — real names, dates, places. Opening with definitions is a Blocker.
- **S2 · Major — Act 2: depth on the story.** The second movement analyzes *that
  same* opening example in depth — not a fresh toy example.
- **S3 · Major — Act 3: generalization.** The third movement extends the analysis
  from the concrete opening case to the general case.
- **S4 · Major — Act 4: edge cases as prompts.** The final movement probes edge
  cases, each posed **as a question to the audience** before any resolution
  (what if it's empty? disconnected? a single item? reversed?).
- **S5a · Major — A demo the presenter cannot launch is not a demo.** If a milestone
  slide points at a live tool, the link must be **on the slide** and clickable in the
  HTML export. A demo link that lives only in the speaker note, without a scheme, means
  the presenter has to retype it mid-talk. Check the export, not the markdown:
  `grep -o 'href="http[^"]*"' out.html`.
- **S5 · Major — Demo at every milestone.** Each milestone (≈ each part) contains
  an interactive element: a demo, worksheet, trace-it-yourself activity, poll, or
  live widget. A milestone without one is a Major per milestone.

## Report format

```markdown
# Slide review — <deck path> — <date>

**Verdict:** FAIL | NEEDS WORK | PASS
**Slides:** <N> · **Blockers:** <n> · **Majors:** <n> · **Minors:** <n>

**Milestones:** (structure pass, S5)
- Part 1 <title> — demo: <yes: what / MISSING>
- …

## Blockers
1. Slide 12 "<title>" — L2 — <evidence: what the rendered slide shows> — Fix: <concrete change>.

## Majors
…

## Minors
…
```

Every finding names the slide (number + title), the criterion ID, the evidence as
seen on the **rendered** slide, and a concrete fix. Deck-level findings (S-criteria)
use "deck" in place of a slide number.

## Calibration examples

Before the first review round of a new deck, build a small calibration set from
what that round actually finds — 2–3 concrete findings in the exact report format
above, so later rounds (and other reviewers) read findings the same way. The three
worked examples below are generic placeholders to show the format; replace them
with real findings from your own deck's first round as soon as you have one.

- **F1 Blocker (worked example).** A diagram has three elements filled in two
  different colors with no legend or label explaining what the colors mean, and
  two connector lines are curved so closely they nearly touch. Nothing on the
  slide explains either choice. Fix: pick one color per meaning and state it in
  the caption; separate the near-touching lines or merge them if they carry the
  same information.
- **L2 Blocker (worked example).** A slide presents a 4-row, 3-column data table
  summarizing categories and counts. Fix: put the counts directly on an annotated
  figure (e.g. a bar-free dot plot or the objects themselves), instead of a table.
- **Pass (worked example).** An opening slide poses a concrete, dated real-world
  scenario as a question, includes a labeled figure grounding it, and closes with
  a conversational prompt ("What would you guess happens next?") rather than
  answering immediately.

## Keeping this current

Same contract as the other guides in this skill family — `DECK_BUILD_GUIDE.md` and
`FIGURE_GUIDE.md` (authoring, in `slide-build/`), `REVIEW_PLAYBOOK.md` (the review
loop, alongside this file in `slide-review/`) — when a review teaches something new
about *what good looks like*, add it here; loop-process lessons go to
`REVIEW_PLAYBOOK.md`, authoring lessons go to `DECK_BUILD_GUIDE.md`/`FIGURE_GUIDE.md`.
