# Slide review playbook

How to run the review → fix → re-verify loop. `SLIDE_RUBRIC.md` (alongside this file)
says what to check; `DECK_BUILD_GUIDE.md` and `FIGURE_GUIDE.md` (in `slide-build/`) say
how to author decks and figures; this file says how to run the loop without repeating
mistakes that have already cost rounds.

Every rule below is here because it failed at least once during an early deck rebuild
(30 slides → 73, nine rounds). Add to it when something new goes wrong.

## The loop

1. **Render every slide to PNG.** Never review from source.
2. **Verify** — reviewers read every rendered PNG, one at a time, and measure rather than
   eyeball.
3. **Plan** — collect the findings into one `review/FIXES_Rn.md` spec.
4. **Fix** — dispatch against that spec; deck markdown and figure generator to *separate*
   agents, never both on one file.
5. **Regenerate figures, re-render, re-verify.** Go to 2.

## Rules that exist because they were broken

### Before trusting any verification, check the render is current

```sh
find figures -name '*.png' -newer review/slide.001.png | wc -l   # must be 0
[ deck.md -nt review/slide.001.png ] && echo STALE
```

This has happened **three times**: a figure agent finished one more fix after the render, so
reviewers spent their pass reading images that no longer matched disk. The first two cost a
full round each. The third was caught by running the check above and cost nothing — the
recovery works, so use it:

1. Message every reviewer: **hold, do not report, wait for the word RERENDERED.**
2. Regenerate figures, delete the old PNGs, re-render, confirm the check returns 0.
3. Message RERENDERED and tell them to re-read their range **from scratch**.

Their text and layout observations survive — the markdown did not change — but every figure
judgment must be redone.

The underlying cause is that fix agents keep working after reporting. Prefer to launch
reviewers only once every fix agent has gone idle, and re-run the check immediately before
you launch them.

**And do not infer idleness from silence — look.** One deck build held all three of its figure
agents, confirmed every one of them idle and every file committed, rendered, measured zero
figures newer than the render, and had a build running the whole time from a *fourth* session
nobody had thought to hold. It was found because one agent went looking rather than reporting
itself clean:

    ps -o pid=,ppid=,command= -ax | grep -E 'make_figures|make_animations|pdflatex' | grep -v grep

That is cheap, gives a definite answer, and names the owning process, so it distinguishes "my
agents are done" from "nothing is writing to this directory" — which are different claims, and only
the second one is the one the render depends on. Run it immediately before rendering, not after.

**When you do find a race, resolve it on content, not on timestamps.** `find -newer` reports that a
build touched a file; it cannot tell you whether the file changed. A build re-run over unchanged
sources rewrites every PNG with a new mtime and identical bytes, and treating that as staleness
throws away a review round for nothing. `git status` on the figure paths answers the question that
actually matters.

The recovery, meanwhile, is narrower than it looks: tell the reviewers to keep reading and hold
their reports. Their images cannot change under them — only the lead re-renders — so their text,
layout, narrative and arithmetic observations are all safe. The single thing at risk is that a
defect correctly reported against the render has already been superseded on disk, which sends a
fixer after something that is no longer there.

### "A caveat on the answer" and "the answer cannot be computed yet" are different sentences

A fix agent, asked to write a number into a slide, sent back three candidate values with a
note that the sweep's sampling quantised all three. That read as a caveat, so the lead
picked one of the three. The right sentence was the second one — the sampling made *none*
of the three computable, and the fix was to resample, not to choose.

Writing the first when the second is true routes a decision to someone who then decides on
incomplete grounds, and it looks like diligence while doing it. If the work you are handing
back cannot answer the question as posed, say that in the first line, before the options.

(The agent that made this mistake is also the one that named it, after the fact, better than
the lead had.)

### Wait for the report, not for silence

Polling a fix agent's file mtimes until they go quiet does **not** tell you it has
finished. It tells you the agent is thinking, reading, or between two edits of a long
pass — and a half-applied generator fails in ways indistinguishable from a broken
hand-off. In one deck build this cost three round-trips: the lead measured a mid-edit tree,
reported the build as abandoned, and was wrong twice in the same hour on the same file.

A fix agent's build is only meaningful **after it reports done**. Until then, whatever you
measure is a snapshot of work in progress. Ask for the report; do not infer it.

The corollary still holds and is not in tension with this: once the agent has reported,
re-measure before trusting the report, and re-run `find figures -newer review/slide.001.png`
immediately before launching reviewers.

### Read the gate's own exit status, not a pipeline's

One deck build's lead reported "gate exit=0" for several consecutive rounds from

    python3 check_render.py 2>&1 | grep -E "all checks|problem"

where `$?` is **grep's** status. The gate had been exiting 1. A verifier ran it unpiped
and found the failure in one line.

Every other entry in this file is about a check that measured the wrong thing. This one
is the same disease one level up — the check was right and the *reading* of it was wrong,
which is harder to notice because nothing looks broken. Run it bare, or capture properly:

    python3 check_render.py > /tmp/gate.txt 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"

and quote the exit status in the round's report, not the words "all checks pass" scraped
out of the middle of the output.

### A gate that cannot fire is worse than no gate

One deck build's render gate had a node-diameter band that was inert for the whole of its
first build. It thresholds on `gray < 60`, and every colour in that palette was lighter
than that — the node blue converted to luminance 88 — so `node_discs()` returned `[]` on
every slide and the 26–52px band went unenforced. A 19px disc passed a green run. Two
reviewers found it independently in the same round.

No gate at all would have been safer, because the green run was read as coverage. When you
add or inherit a gate, prove it fires: run its detector on a slide you know is bad and check
it says so. Then check the summary actually prints the measurement — the missing
`node diameter: …px across N discs` line was the visible symptom for a whole build and
nobody looked for it.

The generator had the same disease from the other end: it *computed* the property it was
asserting instead of measuring it (see `FIGURE_GUIDE.md`, "Measure the render"). Between
them, two independent checks on in-figure type size both passed while every label in the
deck was 17% under the floor.

The next deck build inherited the same inert gate and it stayed inert for that whole build too.
Once it was masking on colour it found 19px, 25px, 52px and 20px discs across five figures in
one run. The line that proves it ran is the measurement, not the verdict:

    node diameter: 26-42px (spread 1.6x) across 351 discs

Corollary: a detector needs a discriminator, not just a filter. Aspect ratio and fill ratio
alone cannot tell a 23px filled grid-cell or an accent-2 letter "o" from a small node disc —
sampling the four bounding-box corners can, because a disc has empty corners and a square
does not.

### When a later round measures a fix as absent, believe the measurement

Round 1 of one deck build specified "re-curve the cyclic diagram's connector lines to remove
the crossings" and the round reported it landed. Round 2 measured the same figure and found
**16 crossings** on a diagram a planarity check calls planar. Both were true: what landed was
a *different* fix — deepening the curve so each enclosed region had a visible interior —
chosen for a good reason (the zero-crossing drawing made every enclosed shape unreadable)
that was recorded only in a docstring inside the generator.

Two rules from that. A fixer who substitutes a different fix must say so **in the report**,
not just in a comment; and a lead who reads "landed" without a measurement has learned
nothing. The round-2 reviewer then supplied the layout that dissolved the trade-off
altogether — an alternative symmetric layout that draws planar *and* keeps its shapes
legible — so the recorded disagreement was what made the third option findable.

### An assertion tells you about the property it measures, and nothing else

One deck build shipped a Blocker straight through a passing assertion, and the assertion was
correct.

The animation generator asserted that the GIF's node layout equalled the quiz figure's
answer-panel layout to 1e-9 — a guard so the animation and the still beside it could not drift
apart. It did exactly that. It also meant the "here is the mechanism" slide drew, node for
node and highlighted element and all, the answer to the quiz two slides later. The room could
answer by matching pictures.

The withholding check that was supposed to catch this scans the figure's **banned strings**, and
round 1 certified "no leak" on its strength. A graphical leak walks through a textual assertion
without touching it.

Two rules out of that:

- **When an assertion passes, you have learned one fact, not a class of facts.** "Cannot drift"
  and "gives the answer away" were the same fact here, and nothing in the guard knew it.
- **Split a guard that is holding two properties at once.** The fix asserts the *structure* is
  identical (same generator, same parameters, same element set) and the *drawing* is not
  (normalised layouts far apart). Both halves were wanted; only their conjunction was the defect.

The same shape, from the other end, in the same deck: a node-size assertion computed
`NODE * factor` from the constant it already knew, so a figure that drew at a smaller node
constant passed it, and three markers shipped at 25.5px against a 26px floor. One guaranteed
a real property of the drawing and was blind to what it implied; the other guaranteed the
author's intention and was blind to the drawing.

### The ground-truth side of an assertion must be able to be wrong on its own

One deck build shipped one defect through five rounds of review, and the thing that kept it
alive was an assertion whose job was to catch it. A figure drawing eight items coloured by
whether a local measurement exceeded a reference value asserted:

    rel = 1 if local_mean(x) > reference(x) else -1 if ... else 0   # derived from the data
    assert rel == {"accenttwo": 1, "accent": -1, "annot": 0}[fill]  # written two lines above

The data was right. The comparison was right. The **map from comparison to colour was inverted**,
and it sat inside the thing whose job was to catch inversions. The assertion passed every round and
reported the mapping verified.

"Do not assert against literals" is the wrong lesson — it would ban a lot of good assertions. The
invariant is structural:

> **The side of an assertion you are treating as ground truth must come from somewhere that can be
> wrong independently of the code under test.**

A dict written two lines above the thing it checks cannot be. Swap which side is derived and the
same line becomes a real test. In practice that means the expected side comes from a shared module,
a measurement of the render, or the source data — not from a constant the author wrote while writing
the thing it guards.

The corollary the same deck paid for four times: **a shared constant binds only where someone
remembers to reach for it; a shared builder binds everywhere it is called.** One round fixed an axis
mismatch by importing two constants, and the half of the axis those constants did not cover stayed
wrong. The next round fixed it by calling the shared axis *builder*. Same for the colour roles —
declaring them bound the two functions that were named, and the two that were not kept calling the
primitive directly.

### A green build line is not evidence about the file on disk

Late in one deck build a figure agent edited a generator, rebuilt, read `1 figures written, 0
failed`, opened the PNG — and it was the previous image. It knew, because the drawing on screen
could not have passed the assertion the build had just reported passing, so it measured the file:

    accent-2 101536 px, accent 45423 px    <- on disk after a "successful" build
    accent-2  45409 px, accent     0 px    <- after rm + rebuild

The likely mechanism is mundane and worth naming: this build had, more than once, **two
`make_figures.py` processes writing into the same directory at the same time**, one of them from a
session nobody had thought to hold. A process reports success for the write it performed; the bytes
that survive can be the other one's.

The guard is cheap: **delete a figure's PNG before regenerating it.** Then "did it actually write"
cannot be answered by accident — if the file is absent and the build is green, the file on disk is
the file the code describes.

This is the render-staleness failure one level down. There, the render was stale relative to the
figures. Here, the figure was stale relative to its own generator, and nothing in the output said so.

### Assert on the numbers that describe the canvas, not the numbers that describe the content

One deck build spent three rounds refining one rule, and this is where it ended up.

Round 3: **assert on the coordinates actually drawn.** A clearance gate passed at 46bp in a
canonical box, the layout was then scaled by 0.873 into a narrower panel, and six discs fused at
40.1bp against 40bp discs.

Round 4 found the narrower and more useful version. A figure teaching that a cumulative curve's
slope is one less than its underlying distribution's slope drew the two panels at **0.4099 and
0.3915** — 4.5% apart, where the claim is 2.5 against 1.5 — because the panels spent six and four
decades in boxes of identical height, so the change of ruler cancelled the change of slope. The
guard meant to catch it fit two power curves against each other and asserted they differed by
one: arithmetic on arrays the author had constructed.

What found it was **bp per decade, measured off the box dimensions** — the only quantity in that
figure that neither the data nor the author's intention can reach.

> A slope is content. Bp per decade is canvas. Assert the canvas.

The same test retires a whole family: a label's position is content, its ink box is canvas; a
node's size is content, its drawn diameter is canvas; "the two states differ by one line" is
content, "the two PNGs are pixel-identical above row 313" is canvas.

### A gate is blind to whatever the drawing primitives do not tell it about

Three of one deck build's gate gaps were the same gap. The collision gate could not see a
**fill**, because `fill_poly` reported nothing. It could not see a **frame border**, because a
rectangle is one path and the gate only knew `seg()`. And the node-size gate could not see a
**gray or hollow disc**, because `NODE_FILLS` listed two colours.

Each was found by a reviewer measuring the render, months of rounds apart, and each was one line to
close once someone looked at the primitive rather than at the check. So when a gate passes on a
figure you can see is wrong, ask what the drawing *told* it — not what it examined.

The corollary bites: **a private helper that bypasses the shared primitive is a hole in every gate
built on it.** `figs_extra.py` kept its own `rect()` after the shared figure library learned to
record, so the frame blockers were live and that file's frames were still invisible. A later deck
build paid it again — a ring drawn around a node was measured *as* the node.

### A mechanical edit must assert that it matched

A fixer applying twenty wording changes reaches for `str.replace`, and a `str.replace` whose
pattern was never in the file returns the file unchanged and reports success. That is
indistinguishable from a landed fix, and it is one of the ways this project has twice reported a
repair the render contradicted.

One deck build's editing agent ran its edits as one script that **asserts each pattern matched exactly
once** and aborts otherwise, printing "all 23 replacements applied, each matched exactly once".
Exactly once, not at least once: a pattern that matches twice has found something the author did
not know was there, which is worth stopping for.

### An assertion that is never called is not a check

An `assert_no_crossings()` guard sat in one deck build's generator with a docstring reading "a
figure whose claim is a clean layout must not draw phantom overlaps", wired into exactly one
figure. The figure that shipped 34 crossings under a caption asserting there were none was not
one of them. Grep for every guard the codebase defines and check where it is *called*, not where
it is defined.

### Measure on the rendered slide, not the source PNG

**Three consecutive rounds reported "node size is now uniform deck-wide" and were followed
by a verifier measuring an 8×, then a 16×, spread.** The assertion was true — every source
PNG carried a 150px disc — and irrelevant, because the deck scales each image by a different
factor (0.14×–0.34×) that the generator never sees. The defect lives on the slide, so the
measurement has to happen on the slide.

Same for text size. A figure whose type is comfortable at source resolution can land at 3px
on the slide.

### A fixer must re-read the rendered PNG before reporting done

**Every round contained at least one repair reported as landed that the render contradicted.**
Reading the source PNG is not enough (see above). Reading the code is not enough. Open the
slide.

### Fix at the generator, not at the figure

A defect class fixed on the named figure reappears on the next figure someone draws. Labels
sitting on filled discs were reported **five times on five different figures across four
rounds** before anyone wrote a placement helper with an assertion. A connector that loops back
to its own origin failed six rounds under three different-looking explanations, all of which
were the same missing invariant.

When a finding is geometric, ask what invariant was violated, then assert it and let the
build fail. Assertions caught, before any human looked: four rings drawn inside the node they
were meant to encircle; an arrowhead standoff calibrated at the wrong linewidth; a traversal
whose numbered visit order jumped between non-adjacent nodes; a cyclic diagram whose connector
lines passed 0.005 units inside the discs they crossed.

### A patch that reports success but never matched looks exactly like a landed fix

Applying fixes with a scripted `str.replace` is fast and it fails silently: if the search
string is off by one escaped backslash, the script prints "patched", exits 0, and changes
nothing. One deck build lost a round that way — a "draw two overlapping circles" figure was
reported fixed, the build was green, and the render still showed five overlapping discs.

Two defences, both cheap. Make the replacement **assert** it matched (`assert old in s`)
rather than trusting `str.replace` to no-op quietly; and re-read the rendered slide before
reporting, which is the rule above and is the one that actually caught it.

### A scripted replacement can eat the fix you just applied

Two edits in one script, both matching on the same URL: the first inserted a link on the
slide, the second rewrote "the URL in the speaker note" — and hit the copy inside the link
it had just created, producing `href="https://The link is on the slide..."`. The script
printed success. Order the replacements so later patterns cannot match earlier insertions,
or make each one match on enough surrounding context to be unambiguous — and then grep the
export for what you claimed to add.

### After changing a figure, check every slide that uses it — and every claim about it

Three separate regressions came from this:

- A data matrix was added to a figure for one slide; the same file was already on a slide 41
  earlier, which then showed an annotated matrix with unexplained colours before the matrix
  was defined.
- Making a diagram's nodes a uniform size hid a set of secondary connector lines on one
  figure, so an enclosed shape it was supposed to reveal became invisible — on the slide
  whose whole claim depended on that shape being visible.
- Fixing a badge overlap on a loop-back-connector answer slide left the question slide correct
  and broke the answer.

**If two slides need different content, emit two files.** Reuse is only safe when both slides
explain the figure the same way.

### Verify the numbers before writing them into a spec

Two mathematical errors reached slides through specs written in this loop:

- A spec asked for "the concrete 12 vs 25 count" as evidence that a compact storage format
  saves memory. That counts one of three arrays the format actually needs; the compact format
  needs 30 against the naive format's 25 at that size, so the slide shipped a false claim that
  also contradicted its own neighbouring slide.
- A spec asserted that a sketch showed irregular freeform shapes. It showed rounded rectangles,
  so the fix built on it could not work.

Compute it, or read the file, before writing it down.

### Make the generator report every failure, not the first

A figure generator that stops at the first failed assertion hides the rest. One deck build's
geometry gates fired in clusters — raising the type size broke seven figures at once — and
stopping at figure 3 of 60 turns one round of fixes into seven. Catch per figure, print each
failure, and exit non-zero at the end:

    bad = []
    for name, fn, cont in FIGURES:
        try:
            emit(name, fn(), cont)
        except AssertionError as e:
            bad.append(str(e)); print(f"  FAIL {name}: {e}")
    if bad: sys.exit(1)

### Watch for a fix that moves an error rather than removing it

A stated mathematical condition was wrong in two consecutive rounds: the first fix corrected
one clause of the condition and moved the error into a second clause, where the deck then
falsified its own rule two slides later using its own figure. When a correctness fix lands,
re-derive the whole statement, not the clause you touched.

### If a subagent review does not arrive, say so in the report

Four reviewers were launched for one deck build's round 1 and none returned. The rounds that
followed were driven by the checker plus a single read, which is weaker coverage than this
playbook intends. Record that in the fix spec rather than letting the round read as a full pass
— the next person needs to know which slides no one looked at.

### Give a fix agent the container list, not the intention

Three figure agents were briefed from the figure spec while the deck was still
being written. Each was told a container per figure; the deck then put several of
them somewhere else, and the build gate failed twenty figures for scale. The brief
was not wrong when it was written — it was written too early.

Dispatch figure work **after** the slide that uses it exists, and paste the
container for each figure into the brief as a list. Ask the agent to report the
emitted line for every figure (`name  WxH bp  node NNpx  x-h NN.Npx  [container]`)
rather than "done": that line is the only evidence that the figure is the size the
deck needs, and it costs the agent nothing to paste.

### Ban private helpers that bypass the shared drawing primitive

One deck build had three gate blind spots that were one gap: the collision gate could not see a
`fill_poly`, could not see a rectangle border, and the node gate could not see a gray or hollow
disc. A later deck build paid it again — a ring drawn around a node was measured *as* the node.
The corollary: **a private helper that bypasses the shared primitive is a hole in every gate
built on it.** `figs_extra.py` kept its own `rect()` after the shared figure library learned to
record, so the frame blockers were live and that file's frames were still invisible. Grep for
private drawing helpers in every figure generator:

    grep -n 'def _\(rect\|fill\|disc\|node\|edge\)' figures/*.py

Any hit is a gate bypass. Route through the shared primitive or extend the gate.

### The ground-truth side of an assertion must be able to be wrong independently

The most expensive content defect in the record: a colour-map dict written two lines
above the assertion that checked it kept an inverted polarity alive through five
rounds of review while reporting the mapping verified. The invariant is structural:

> The side of an assertion you treat as ground truth must come from somewhere that
> can be wrong independently of the code under test — a shared module, a measurement
> of the render, or the source data. Not a constant the author wrote while writing
> the thing it guards.

### Delete a figure's PNG before regenerating it

Two `make_figures.py` processes writing the same directory — one from a session
nobody had held — means a process reports success for the write it performed, but
the bytes that survive can be the other one's. If the file is absent and the build
is green, the file on disk is the file the code describes. Add to the generator:

    os.path.exists(out) and os.remove(out)   # before writing

### Run the source-level checker before any LLM review

The structural checker (`check_deck.py`, alongside `check_render.py` for each deck)
catches tables, code blocks, answer leaks on question slides, figure reuse with
different captions, fragment/paragraph ordering, KaTeX in HTML blocks, demo links
living only in speaker notes, and stale renders — all at zero token cost. Historically
these were found by LLM reviewers reading PNGs at ~10K tokens per slide.

Run it after the render checker and before launching any reviewer:

    cd ~/.claude/skills/slide-build
    python3 -m gatelib check-render /path/to/deck   # pixel-level checks
    python3 -m gatelib check-deck /path/to/deck     # source-level checks
    # only then: LLM review of judgment criteria

A reviewer who spends their pass reporting what `check_deck.py` catches is wasted
tokens. The LLM pass should focus on what automation cannot check: one-point-per-slide,
unexplained encodings, narrative quality, four-act structure, conversational tone.

### A missing figure must fail the gate, not crash it

`check_render.py` opened every figure the deck references and died with a
traceback on the first one that did not exist, which reads as "the checker is
broken" rather than "the deck references a file nobody generated". While a deck is
mid-build that is the normal state and the gate has to survive it: report the
missing file as a failure and carry on, so one run tells you about all of them.

## Expectations

**The Blocker count will not fall monotonically, and that is not necessarily failure.**
One deck's blocker count ran 29 → 7 → 4 → 7 → 9 → 3 → 4 → 11. Two things drive the bumps:

- The deck grows. 30 slides became 73, so there is 2.4× more surface, and every new slide and
  figure is reviewed for the first time.
- Reviewers get more forensic. Later rounds measured pixel positions and colour samples, so
  they found defects earlier rounds' coarser reads had passed over.

What *should* fall monotonically is the **severity class**. Round 1's blockers were structural
— tables, code blocks, three-column text, a missing act, no progressive disclosure. By round 8
they were figure geometry and one arithmetic slip. Track that, not the count.

## Roles

Review and planning want the strongest available model for the session; applying a written spec
to markdown or a figure generator does not. Run reviewers over disjoint slide ranges, write the
fix spec yourself, and dispatch the edits to cheaper agents — one for the deck, one for the
figures, never both on the same file.

### Token-efficient agent architecture

Analysis of session logs across several deck-build projects (148MB, 8,810 messages, 121 agent
spawns) surfaced three structural token sinks, each fixable:

**1. Guide re-reads.** Every spawned agent re-reads SLIDE_RUBRIC.md, REVIEW_PLAYBOOK.md,
FIGURE_GUIDE.md, DECK_BUILD_GUIDE.md — 49 reads across sessions, ~370K tokens. Fix:
inject the relevant excerpts into the agent's brief. The lead reads the guides once;
workers get only the sections their task touches.

**2. Full-deck LLM review per round.** 224 PNG reads at ~10K tokens each ≈ 2.2M tokens
per deck. Most structural findings are caught by `check_deck.py` at zero cost.
Adopt a tiered review:

- **Tier 0**: `check_render.py` + `check_deck.py` — automated, zero tokens. Runs every
  round. Measure what fraction of findings it catches on the next deck's first round; set
  Tier 1's scope from that number, not from an estimate.
- **Tier 1**: LLM reviews only slides whose RENDER HASH changed since last round
  (computed by `check_deck.py`, stored in `review/.render_hashes.json`). A figure edit
  propagates to every slide that uses it; a CSS edit propagates deck-wide. Both are
  caught by hashing the render, not the markdown source. Review only judgment criteria
  (P1, F1, F4, N1–N4, S1–S5) on those slides.
- **Tier 2**: Full-deck LLM review, all criteria — once per deck, before shipping.

**Caveat**: three regressions in the record are unchanged slides broken by a changed
figure. "Unchanged" and "reviewed" are different claims. The render hash is the
correct change detector because it captures exactly what a reviewer would see.

**2b. Image read token cost.** 281 image reads across sessions — 63% of all Read calls.
Estimated ~422K tokens, larger than guide re-reads (~370K). 56 reads (20%) were
duplicates of the same image. Three mitigations, implemented in `gatelib/review_images.py`:

- **Downscale before review.** 1280x720 → 640x360 costs ~307 tokens per slide instead
  of ~1,229 — 75% saving. Text at 30px body remains readable at half scale.
  Run `python3 -m gatelib prepare /path/to/deck` after rendering.
- **Review changed slides only.** The render hash in `check_deck.py` identifies which
  slides changed. `--changed-only` filters to those. A typical round touches 10–20
  slides, not 70+.
- **Contact sheet for small batches.** When reviewing ≤ 12 changed slides, tile them
  into one image to save tool-call round-trips.

**3. Inter-agent message overhead.** 207 SendMessage calls at ~2K tokens each. Reduce
agent count: 3 agents per round (lead + deck-fixer + figure-fixer), not 8+. The lead
collects findings and writes the spec; workers apply it. No reviewer agents in Tier 1 —
the lead IS the reviewer.

**4. Session-limit failures.** 8 mid-build crashes across sessions. Mitigate:
- Commit after every successful gate pass, not just at round end
- Write `review/CHECKPOINT.md` after each round: round number, gate status, pending
  fixes, which agents were running
- On re-entry, read CHECKPOINT.md to resume without re-doing completed work
