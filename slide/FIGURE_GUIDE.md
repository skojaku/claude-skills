# Figure authoring guide

Standards for figures in a Marp slide deck. Written to be executable by **any** agent, like
`SLIDE_RUBRIC.md` — it uses only tool names and file paths.

This exists because rebuilding one early deck took eight review rounds, and roughly a
third of every round's findings were figure defects that the authoring setup made
possible. The rules below are what those rounds cost.

## Tool choice

**Do not reach for matplotlib for node-link diagrams.** It models a *plot*, not a diagram,
so node radius, edge endpoints and text size are all things you compute rather than
declare — an early deck used it for exactly that and it was the wrong default.

| what you are drawing | use |
|---|---|
| node-link diagrams (graphs, networks, flowcharts, org charts, state machines — anything with nodes and edges) | **TikZ** |
| data figures (distributions, relationships, matrices) | **Altair**, or **seaborn** |
| anything else | the simplest thing that renders it |

TikZ needs a LaTeX→PNG pipeline (a Quarto TikZ extension, or standalone `pdflatex` +
`pdftoppm`/`convert`). Set it up once per project; after that it is not a new dependency
per deck.

**Why TikZ for node-link diagrams.** The defect class that consumed six of the eight
rounds — self-loop legs that did not meet their node, arrowheads that stopped short, rings
drawn inside the disc they were meant to encircle — cannot be written in TikZ.
`\draw (A) -- (B);` stops at the node's border, whatever the shape. `edge[loop above]` is a
self-loop primitive. `node[above right=2pt of A]` positions against a real anchor rather
than a guessed coordinate. You do not compute boundaries, so you cannot get them wrong.

## Rules

### Author at final size

**The single most expensive mistake in an early deck's rebuild.** Figures were authored in
inches and points, then scaled to the slide by a per-slide `w:` directive the generator
never saw. So in-figure text landed anywhere from 7px to 40px on the slide, and ten of
twelve figures in one range rendered their labels smaller than the page number.

Author so that **one unit is one slide pixel**. Then a 20pt label is 20px on the slide, in
every figure, and there is nothing to reconcile. In TikZ, fix the `tikzpicture` width to
the column width it will occupy. In Altair, set `width`/`height` to the final pixel size.

The same rule fixes node size: one deck's nodes were uniform in *figure* space and still
ranged 68–177px on the slide.

### Measured floors (from early rounds — assert these in the generator)

The deck's containers are fixed: content area **1120px**, a `cols` column **537px**,
display height cap **380px**. So the on-slide size of anything in a figure is computable at
authoring time — these numbers describe the bundled default `theme.css`; re-measure them
against your own theme the same way (render a probe slide, measure the PNG) if you use a
different one:

    scale       = min(container / src_w, 380 / src_h, 1.0)
    on_slide_px = size_pt * (dpi / 72) * scale

- **In-figure text ≥ 15px x-height on the slide** (body is 30px type ≈ 15px x-height).
  Raised repeatedly in early review; it is a build failure now, not a taste note.
- **Assert the x-height, not the cap height.** `check_render.py` measures x-height on the
  rendered slide; asserting cap height in the generator measures a different quantity, and
  for Latin Modern the two disagree by 60% (x-height 0.431 em, cap height 0.683 em). One
  deck shipped 30pt labels that passed a 21px cap-height assertion and landed **13px**
  x-height on forty slides at once — under the floor, and invisible to the build until the
  checker ran. The generator must assert exactly what the checker reads:

      x_height_px = size_pt * XHEIGHT_RATIO * (dpi / 72) * scale   # >= 15.5

  With a 1 bp = 1 slide px pipeline that puts the floor at **36pt**, not 30pt.
- **And assert that the text still fits.** Size and containment are two checks, not one.
  Raising one deck's type until the size assertion went green pushed digits out of their
  cells: a dense inset became a mass of overlapping glyphs and two adjacent labels rendered
  as one run-on number, on the slide that teaches what those boundaries mean. That is worse
  than the small type it replaced, because small text gets skipped and garbled text gets
  misread. Where a cell cannot hold text at the floor, **the cell grows** — never shrink
  the type back.
- **Node discs 26–52px on the slide, if your figures draw circular nodes** — uniform
  enough that the same diagram does not change size between consecutive slides. This check
  is opt-in (pass `node_fills=[...]` to `check_render.run()`); it only matters for decks
  drawing node-link diagrams.
- **Drawing ≥ 150px rendered**, **per-axis margin ≤ 30%**, ink fraction ≥ 15% of the box
  (aim for 35%) — below that the deck is scaling white margin, not the picture.

`check_render.py` (bundled in `gatelib/`) re-measures all of this on the rendered slides
after `marp --images png`; wire it into every deck and keep it exiting 0.

### No bar charts

Use a form that shows the quantity directly — the actual objects, a dot plot, a slope, an
annotated number. Bars encode one number as a length and then need a scale to decode it,
which is where one early figure went wrong: it drew a 7:1 ratio under a label reading
7,700:1.

### No green

The palette is `#3959A6` (accent), `#B14434` (accent-2), `#DAB167` (accent-3), `#6b6b6b`
(annotation gray), `#000000` (ink) — the bundled theme's palette. Nothing else, unless you
have swapped in your own theme and its own palette.

### One colour, one meaning, per figure — and say what it means

In one early deck accent-2 meant, across four consecutive slides: a leftover element, a
pair of endpoints, every edge, a flagged subset, and something else entirely. Pick one
meaning per figure and state it in the figcaption or an in-drawing label.

### Keep it simple

If a figure needs a legend to be read, it is doing too much. One figure, one point. A
multi-panel figure is acceptable only as a build — one panel per step.

### Never share a figure between slides that explain it differently

One deck's figure gained an added panel for a much later slide, and the same file was
already in use 41 slides earlier — so the audience met unexplained colour-coding long
before it was defined. If two slides need different content, emit two files.

## Gate every drawn box against every other, not just the names

One deck's second review round on a batch of figures found seven new defects and six of
them were one thing: **an in-figure text box drawn where something else already is.**
Annotation over annotation on three panels of one build; five separate overlaps on a single
derivation figure; a count struck through by its own axis rule; a legend line crossed by
the curve it names. Every one was a box that grew, or an axis that moved, after somebody
chose the position by hand.

The label solver already existed and only names went through it. So the gate now runs on
every figure: collect every drawn text box — including tick labels and axis titles —
every rule, and the sampled curves, and fail the build if any text box intersects any of
them. Its first run failed **thirteen figures across three batches**, including four made
that evening that no reviewer had seen, and it independently rediscovered the two
collisions the round-2 reviewer had measured by hand on the render. Fixing at the generator
is worth a round; fixing seven of them one at a time is worth nothing, because the eighth
is already being drawn.

The failure message must say **shorten the note or move the panel, and never shrink the
type**. Both of the times a deck's type quietly got smaller to make room, a reviewer found
it before anyone noticed the drawing had changed.

### But size the boxes from glyphs, not from source characters

`label_box` estimates a label's width as `CHAR_W * size * len(string)`, and that estimate
is wrong in two compounding directions. It counts **source** characters, so a short LaTeX
expression like `$\langle k^2\rangle$` models as a 408bp box around an 85bp glyph. And
`CHAR_W` is 0.55 em against a measured 0.43.

Both errors are conservative for a collision test, which is why they survived — but
conservative is not free:

- The gate refuses layouts that are fine, and the author moves a drawing that was never
  wrong.
- **An arrow that terminates at a label cannot be drawn at all.** The arrowhead is inside
  the modelled box by construction, and stopping outside it leaves a ~160bp gap. One deck
  got out of this by routing the flow *past* the label rather than into it — which turned
  out to be a better figure — but it is a dodge, and the next labelled flow will hit the
  same wall.

The fix is the one this guide already prescribes two sections down for type size:
**measure the compiled string** the way `calibrate()` measures x-height. The collision gate
is a computed assertion — three numbers the author already knew — and "a computed
assertion can only restate the author's intention" is not a new rule, it is this one not
yet applied to the newest gate.

**Do not take the obvious middle path.** Stripping the TeX markup and dropping `CHAR_W` to
the measured 0.43 looks like the cheap version of the same idea. Measured, it is worse than
the bug:

    $\langle k^2\rangle$   today, 0.55 em x 20 source chars : 408.0 bp   4.8x OVER
                           strip markup, 0.43 em x 3 chars  :  58.4 bp    31% UNDER
                           measured ink                      :  85.0 bp

Plain text is fine under either scheme; the whole error lives in math and escapes, and
naive stripping turns a superscript into two characters where it renders as a letter plus a
raised digit. So today's estimate is wrong in the **safe** direction — it refuses good
layouts, which is annoying and visible — and the cheap fix makes it wrong in the direction
the gate exists to prevent: a missed collision, invisible until a reviewer finds it two
rounds later.

Two notes for whoever implements it. The measurement is a pure function of (string, size,
font) and never changes between builds, so a JSON cache keyed by a hash means the first
build pays for pdflatex and no later build does. And an ink box is *tighter* than a
typographic box, so two labels 2bp apart would pass — add a small explicit pad, but pad a
measured box, not a guessed one, or the two errors compound.

**Resist the escape hatch.** The tempting alternative is a "label anchor" primitive that
arrows are allowed to reach. It fixes one symptom, leaves the over-estimate that costs real
content elsewhere, and — once authors know a way to tell the gate an object is legal — it
will silence true positives as readily as false ones. The gate's whole value is that it
fires without the author thinking about it.

## Place labels with a solver, not by hand

One deck's working map figure has two points 17 units apart on a wider map, and eight
labels between four and nine characters long. Hand-assigning a side per label cost an
afternoon and still produced collisions; worse, the hand-written check exempted a label's
own anchor point, which hid a real bug — the anchor and the offset had been paired
backwards, so half the candidate positions sat **on top of** the point they belonged to.

Write a backtracking placement solver instead. For each label try the eight sides in order
and reject a position that hits: another label, **any** node or disc (including its own),
an edge that matters, an edge-weight chip, or the canvas bounds. Do the same for numbers
printed on edges — chips left at the plain midpoint collided wherever two edges met at a
node. Solve names first, then chips against the names.

When no assignment exists, **say so and stop**. Do not let the type shrink to make room:

    raise SystemExit("label placement failed — no collision-free side assignment exists.\n"
                     "Move a node, shorten a name, or widen the canvas; do not shrink the type.")

A useful corollary: give the solver a vertical band, not the whole canvas. The cropped
drawing has a hard height budget (`container_w * 380 / container_px`), and a label the
solver placed 40bp higher than expected is what pushes a figure over it.

## Square figures cannot pass both gates in a column

The width floor (ink ≥ 76% of the canvas) and the height cap fight each other: in a 520bp
`cols` column a circle wide enough for the first is too tall for the second. Draw
ring-shaped figures as a **wide ellipse**, and rotate the layout so two nodes sit at the
horizontal extremes — a hexagon started at 90° is only 87% as wide as its own bounding
circle, which was the difference between 67% and 83% ink span.

## Assert that the drawing is on the page

The page is fixed to the design canvas, so anything drawn past its edge is **clipped**,
silently, and the crop step cannot tell you — it only removes whitespace. Four reviewer
Blockers on one deck were one missing assertion: a title lost both its ends mid-word, and
two figures whose right-hand elements rendered as half-shapes.

    ys, xs = np.where(gray < 200)
    assert not (xs.min() <= 2 or xs.max() >= W - 3
                or ys.min() <= 2 or ys.max() >= H - 3), "ink runs off the page"

Ink touching an edge is a clip, not a crop. The same run caught two more figures nobody had
reported.

**And assert that in-figure notes clear the labels.** A note is placed at a fixed corner
while names are placed by the solver, so a note that grows collides with whatever the
solver put there — a one-line caption was once drawn straight through a place name.
Compute the note's box and check it against every label box; the failure message should
say *shorten it*, because a long note is the bug (notes carry numbers, prose lives in the
figcaption).

## Assertions

Whatever the tool: **assert the facts the figure draws, and let the build fail.** This was
the most effective thing in the whole rebuild — more effective than any library choice.
Assertions caught, each of them before a human ever looked:

- four rings drawn *inside* the node they were meant to encircle
- an arrowhead standoff that was calibrated at the wrong linewidth (the gap scales with the
  arrow's own stroke width, ~1.12pt per 1pt — it is not a constant)
- a step-by-step figure whose numbered order jumped between non-adjacent elements
- a lattice figure whose connecting lines passed 0.005 units inside the discs they crossed,
  hiding the very structure a slide was claiming to show

**Round percentages in decimal, not in binary.** A measured 0.575 is 57.49999999999999 as
a float, so `f"{x*100:.0f}"` prints 57 while the deck's prose says 58 — one slide, two
numbers, and the figure was regenerated twice before anyone looked at the float. Format
through `Decimal(repr(x)) * 100` with `ROUND_HALF_UP`; `repr` is the shortest string that
round-trips, so the multiply happens in decimal.

Assert the arithmetic too. Compute every number a figure prints from the data, never
hardcode it. One deck shipped a figure claiming a compact data structure stored 12 numbers
against a dense structure's 25, when the compact structure actually needed 30 — it counted
one of three underlying arrays.

### Assert a drawn object against its data, never against itself

One deck's highlighted range on a log-scale figure was drawn from two constants and guarded
by `assert log10(BAND_HI / BAND_LO) >= 2.0` — an assertion that a rectangle is as wide as
the two numbers that define it. It passed on every build while the band's left edge sat in
a regime where the deck's own measured sweep says the claimed effect was only 22% of what
the slide said, i.e. where the claimed property does not hold at all.

Worse is how it got there: the slide claimed "two orders of magnitude", the drawn band was
1.39 decades, and the fix chosen was to widen the band. **That makes the figure fit the
sentence.** Derive the object from the data under a criterion written down in the code,
assert the derived value, print the criterion on the slide, and let the prose say whatever
comes out. Under three defensible criteria that band is 0.33, 0.67 or 1.33 decades — never
the number the sentence wanted.

This is the same failure as picking a flattering random seed, one level up. Both choose the
evidence.

### A tripwire must not encode the conclusion

Having derived that band from the data, the generator then grew a guard against the number
going stale:

    assert BAND_DECADES >= 1.0, "under one decade the deck cannot say ..."

The intent was right and the threshold was picked *after* seeing the answer come out at
1.18. An assertion cannot say "rewrite the sentence"; it can only fail the build. So if a
better sweep had put the honest band at 0.9 decades, the build would have broken and the
cheapest way to make it pass would have been to move the criterion until the number was a
decade again — the same disease as widening the band, with the sign flipped: *assert that
the data must permit the sentence.*

Pin the tripwire to the value the prose was actually written to, so it fires on movement in
**either** direction and names the prose as the thing to update:

    # this slide's sentence is written to this number. If the sweep, the criterion or the
    # edge rule changes, this fires -- update the sentence and this constant together.
    # Do NOT satisfy it by moving the band.
    DECK_BAND_DECADES = 1.18
    assert abs(BAND_DECADES - DECK_BAND_DECADES) < 0.05, ...

That version cannot be satisfied by moving the drawing. Worth knowing that this defect
arrived inside a safeguard written against the very defect it reproduced, and that it was a
reviewer who spotted it, not the author.

### When two readings of the same data disagree, suspect the sampling

The same band could be read two ways — snap the edges to the sampled points (0.67 decades)
or solve the drawn polyline for its threshold crossings (1.18 decades). Both readings were
argued well and they differ by a factor of three. Neither was the answer: the sweep was 13
points over four decades, one per third of a decade, and the whole disagreement was an
artefact of that spacing. Resampling finely enough that the two readings converge dissolves
the question instead of adjudicating it.

The tell is that the argument is about *how to read* the data rather than about what the
data says.

### Measure the render. Never compute what you can measure.

One deck's generator asserted in-figure text size as `FONT * CAP_RATIO * scale` — three
numbers it already knew — and passed on every figure while the whole deck shipped 17% under
the floor. Stock Computer Modern has no 30pt design size, so LaTeX had silently substituted
24.88pt:

    LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/cmr/m/n' in size <30> not available
    (Font) size <24.88> substituted

A computed assertion can only restate the author's intention. Compile one calibration glyph
at the size you asked for, **measure its ink**, and assert against that. The same rule
retires `CAP_RATIO` as a constant: derive it per build.

(The fix for this particular trap is `\usepackage{lmodern}`, and failing the build when
`pdflatex`'s log contains `not available`.)

Unicode is part of the same rule. The house figure font renders an em dash (—) but not
U+2192 (→), which comes out as a tofu box — and only the render says so. Prefer words
("past this line, …") or mathtext arrows over raw arrow codepoints, and re-read the PNG
after any string change, however cosmetic.

### Assert that two discs in one figure do not overlap

Every gate in the build measures **one thing at a time** — this disc's size, that label's
x-height, the ink span of the whole canvas. Overlap is not a property of any one disc, so
none of them can see it. One deck's illustrative scatter figure placed fourteen discs with
`rng.uniform` and five of them merged into three blobs on the rendered slide, under a green
run.

    _DISC_RE.findall(body)  ->  [(size, x, y), ...]
    for each pair: assert hypot(dx, dy) >= (si + sj) / 2 + 1

Wired into `emit()`, it fired on the first run against a figure nobody had complained
about: two clustered groups of nodes whose facing members sat 20bp apart with 32bp discs.
Node-link figures already get this from `clearance_bad`; this catches the free-floating
ones, which are exactly the figures nobody thinks to check.

### A GIF's first frame is what the static export shows

Marp renders frame one into the PNG and PDF exports, so that frame is what the printed
handout and the slide-review render contain — the animation only exists in the browser. One
deck's iterative-shrinking animation led with the untouched starting state: in the export
that slide repeated an earlier figure and taught nothing. **Lead with the frame that
carries the claim** (the settled end-state), then let the loop replay the derivation.

### Labels on an axis need a solver too, not just labels on nodes

`place_labels` was written for node names and the lesson stopped there. One deck's
number-line figures put every mark label at a fixed offset from its own tick, and two marks
half a unit apart printed straight through each other — two labels merged into one
unreadable run on one slide, and a label overprinting a nearby annotation on another. Both
were invisible in the source and both passed the gate. Any label whose position is computed
from a *data value* can collide with another one; walk it outward row by row and fail the
build when no row is free.

### Ink drawn outside the canvas does not exist

A canvas-edge check catches ink *touching* the border and says nothing about ink entirely
beyond it, which simply never renders. One deck lost an axis title placed at `y = -2` that
way. Assert the coordinates, not the pixels: the generator wrote those numbers, so check
`0 <= x <= w` and `0 <= y <= h` for every one of them.

### A legend outside the axes is ink outside the canvas

The deck's figures save at a fixed canvas (no `bbox_inches='tight'`, see "The figure and
the deck must agree on the container"), so a legend placed beside or below the axes clips
at the canvas edge without any error. One review round found five figures clipping at
once: two legends lost their bottom entries (the top curve of one plot had no key at all),
one lost its right column mid-word, and two clipped row labels at the left edge. After
every regeneration, open the PNG and check that **every plotted series has a visible,
unclipped legend entry** — a legend that lists 7 of 10 series passes every automated gate
and fails the room. Budget the axes rectangle for the legend explicitly
(`subplots_adjust`), and re-measure whenever an entry's text grows: "faded = not the
series' best condition" fit until it didn't.

### More than ~14 labelled rows cannot fit the 10 × 4.3 in canvas

At the house tick size a row label needs ~30 px of slide height; the canvas has ~420 px of
axes. A 16-row pairwise comparison ("cross: author -> reviewer", 46 chars, ragged) was
unreadable at every font size tried — shrinking the labels to fit made them illegible, and
keeping them legible made them overlap. The fix was never typographic: re-encode. Group by
one factor as columns (four authors), encode the second factor as marker colour (four
reviewers), and draw the shared reference (the author's own rate) as a line per column.
Same data, 4 labels instead of 16, and the left-to-right change becomes the finding.

### Highlight the winner by fading the rest

When a figure compares several conditions per series and the slide's question is "which
one wins", keep only each series' best condition at full colour and blend every other
point toward white (`vizstyle.fade`, ~0.68 toward white keeps the hue recognisable). The
eye lands on the answer without a second encoding channel. Two rules make it honest: the
fade must be named in the legend ("faded = not the best condition"), and when the x axis
is blocks that answer different questions, pick a winner per block, not per row.

### accent-3 is for fills and rings — never text, never a thin stroke

Gold on white measures **2.01:1** contrast where accent-2 on the same figure measures
5.53:1; the floor for large text is 3:1. A gold label is invisible from the back row and a
gold 2bp stroke is nearly as bad. Use it for shaded bands and highlight rings, where area
carries it.

### Assert the crossing count on any figure whose claim depends on it being crossing-free

A lattice-style diagram with every skip-connection bowed the same way crosses its
neighbours at every node — sixteen crossings on a slide whose whole point was a
crossing-free structure, with each intended shape reading as a lens instead. The underlying
structure was provably planar. Count the intersections between drawn paths and assert zero
wherever a planar drawing exists.

### The figure and the deck must agree on the container

A figure authored for the 1120px content area and then dropped into a 537px `cols` column
renders at **48%** of its intended scale — 19px node discs on a slide whose twin, laid out
full width, shows 39px. Nothing in the source looks wrong. Compute both numbers and compare
them in the build gate.

**And the container is not one number — read the theme, then read the deck.** One deck
assumed two factors (col and full width) and the theme applies at least four. Two separate
caps were missed:

- Marp wraps a figure in a `<p>`, so `section p { max-width: 1080px }` binds before the
  1120px content area. Full width is **1080**, not 1120.
- The `.fig` modifiers change the height cap — `.fig.tight` to 320px, `.fig.stack` to 190px
  — and on a wide figure the **height** binds first, dropping the factor from 0.98 to 0.87.
  Sixteen slides shipped 13–14px type against a 15px floor that way, and the gate passed
  them because it used 380 for everything.

So the scale is `min(width_cap / file_w, height_cap / file_h)` where both caps come from
the class the **deck's markup** actually applies. Parse the deck for it. A generator's own
table of intended containers is not evidence: in one deck the table and the deck disagreed
twice.

## Traps found the hard way

- **matplotlib `scatter` marker size is in points²**, so the node's radius *in data
  coordinates* scales with the axes limits. The same `s=900` gives 0.0672, 0.1344 or 0.2688
  depending on `xlim`. Every edge and annotation endpoint computed from a guess. If you must
  use matplotlib, draw nodes as `Circle` patches with a radius in data units.
- **The default backend reports `fig.dpi = 400` on a Retina Mac**, so figures saved through a
  path that defaults to `fig.dpi` render at 2× on that machine only. Force `matplotlib.use("Agg")`.
- **Marp strips `style` attributes** from HTML in the deck, so inline CSS in a slide silently
  does nothing. Put it in the theme.
- **KaTeX does not process `<figcaption>`** — math there renders as literal `$…$`.

## When the label solver says no, the drawing is the thing that has to move

One deck's working map is twelve named locations with names as long as "Thessalonica", and
on a true longitude/latitude projection `place_labels` cannot place them at all — three
locations have **zero** collision-free sides before any other label exists, because the
projection puts four of them inside 170 bp of width and each needs a ~170 bp label.
Annealing the node positions did not help while the projection was held fixed, and neither
did splitting the long names across two lines.

Three things fixed it, in this order, and the order matters:

1. **Make the layout schematic, and hold it to the geography with a statistic rather than
   with a projection.** The final coordinates come from an annealing search whose *hard*
   constraints are planarity, disc clearance and label-solvability, and whose objective is
   Spearman correlation against the true coordinates. Longitude order came out exactly
   preserved and latitude at rho = 0.95, so the presenter can still point at it and say
   roughly where things are. Assert both correlations in the generator; a layout edit that
   scrambles the map is then a build failure rather than a thing nobody notices.
2. **Give the figure the height it needs, measured.** The plain `.fig` cap of 380 px leaves
   356 bp of ink and there is no solution at 356 or at 376; at 396 every name fits on one of
   the four *nearest* sides of its own disc. That is why the theme has a `.fig.tall`
   modifier — added at 400 px after rendering a probe slide and measuring where the ink
   actually ended, not guessed.
3. **Restrict the solver to the near sides.** A label 46 bp from its disc, with another disc
   closer to it, does not read as that location's name. Solving with only the four nearest
   offsets and failing otherwise is better than a solution nobody can parse.

### A halo, not a chip

Once labels are allowed to lie across edges — and with eighteen edges among twelve nodes
they must be — the question is what to draw under the text. A white **chip** (a filled
rectangle behind the label) was built first and produced a map whose connecting lines were
chopped into pieces: one route simply stopped, and the reviewer's eye read the gap as a
missing edge. A white **halo** (the text drawn eight times in white at ±2 bp, then once in
black) lets the line show through between the letters, which is what an atlas does.

The halo does leave short black stubs where a line enters and leaves a word, and
`check_render.py`'s `smallest_text` heuristic reports those as 1 px "text". Expect the
warning on every haloed figure; it is the heuristic being fooled, and the generator's
measured assertion is the gate that matters. Reduce the stubs by having the solver
**hill-climb its own answer for the fewest edge crossings** — the first feasible assignment
is rarely the tidiest, and re-picking each label's side to minimise crossings is a dozen
lines.

## A highlight ring around a node breaks the node-size gate

`check_render.py` finds discs by masking the node fill colours and then filling holes, so a
disc drawn *inside* an accent-2 ring is one solid blob to it. One deck marked its
highlighted node with a ring 13 bp larger than the disc and failed the 26–52 px band on ten
slides at once, at a measured 57 px, while every disc in the figure was drawn at 40.

Mark a node with a **heavy border on the disc itself** (5 bp) plus a glyph outside it. The
border adds its own width and nothing else, the glyph is the wrong shape to be counted as a
disc, and the measurement then matches what was drawn. A ring in accent-3 is also safe,
because gold is not one of the fills the gate masks — but do not rely on that without
checking `NODE_FILLS`.

## An in-drawing note needs somewhere to go, and a full map has nowhere

`note()` should try several anchors and fail loudly when none is clear, rather than being
pinned to a corner. On one deck's map figure — twelve labelled discs spanning 92% of the
canvas — the honest answer was that *no* corner is free, and the notes came off the figures
entirely: the numbers moved into the slide's body text and the encoding into the
figcaption, which is where this guide says prose belongs all along. A gate that says "this
does not fit anywhere" is telling you the figure is full, not that the gate is too strict.

## Review

Figures are reviewed on the **rendered slide**, never on the source or the standalone PNG.
`SLIDE_RUBRIC.md` has the procedure. Measure rather than eyeball: over eight rounds, every
single round contained at least one repair reported as landed that the rendered image
contradicted.
